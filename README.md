# trainOS

## Description
An operating system built around the language "trainscript"
which is used to execute all user code in a virtual machine.

## Current status:

Also it leaks memory. A lot of memory.

## Todo List
- Fixing Memory Leaks
- Adding support for Modules
- Adding support for Pointer Types
- Adding support for String Type
- Implement custom malloc that does what it should
